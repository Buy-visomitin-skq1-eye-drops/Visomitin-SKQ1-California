A few years ago a small molecule [SkQ1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkQ) was synthesized by the group of professor [Vladimir P. Skulachev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxfPTYRmYVM) in the [Moscow State University.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University) One part of SkQ1 functions as a molecular “tow truck” carrying the other part of the molecule – an extremely active antioxidant plastoquinone – into mitochondria. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results showed that SkQ1 was delivered into the mitochondria in an extremely targeted and efficient manner. The physics of the mitochondrial membrane and the unique properties of SkQ1 direct it into the inner leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane with high precision.

The presence of SkQ1 in the mitochondrial membrane enables mitochondria to protect itself from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by breaking the chain reaction of lipid destruction.This ability of the lead molecule to protect cells against oxidative stress is the key to treating patients suffering from various age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and ophthalmic conditions.More than a dozen studies have been conducted and showed SkQ1 effectiveness in such critical therapeutic areas as the following:
 * Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
 * Dry eye syndrome (DES)
 * Non-infectious uveitis
 * Cataract
 * Glaucoma
